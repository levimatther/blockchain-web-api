## Blockchain Web API 

- I develop this web-api as I learn about web development and it is a fullstack web app at this moment. Since I do not have any concern for design, I did not put too much effort on front-end design.

- I used the blockchain library I wrote for this project. I developed a blockchain api and a rest api for the web server.

- This project is an example of centralized blockchain approach, so it does not work between peers. Blockchain api works only for the web server and therefore every transaction made by users are being processed by the web server. I also used a database for the web server.

## The components I used: 
- The blockchain library I wrote and its API.
- Node.js and express.js for the web server.
- React.js for the client side of web server.
- MongoDB for the blockchain database and user sessions.

## Web-api Examples:

### User wallet

## Usage
#### To start the web api:
- Execute startServer.py with node modules.

#### To start blockchain app:
- You can use "npm start" to run react app. For additional information you may read readme file of blockchain app.
